# `modules/` directory

The purpose of the `modules` directory is to contain **reusable, *optional* configurations** or modules that can be included **selectively** in device-specific configurations.

- **Usage:** These are configurations that may be shared across multiple devices but are not necessarily included in all devices. They provide a way to modularize configurations for specific features or services.

- **Example:** A module for setting up a web server, a specific development environment, or any custom functionality that is not required on every device.
