# `common/` directory

The purpose of the `common` directory is to contain configuration files that are **universally applied** to all devices. These configurations are shared settings that every machine should have without exception.

- Usage: Place configurations here that you want to include in every device's configuration automatically.

- Example: Shared user accounts, universally needed system packages, and services that should be enabled on all devices (e.g. SSH)
